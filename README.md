- 👋 Hi, I’m @BA-Huz
- 👀 I’m interested in building and developing software.
- 🌱 I’m currently ironing out the kinks on a c++ game made without a game engine and when thats done I'm planning to up my Kotlin game with an android app that I want to work for both mobile android devices and wear OS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any awesome or tough projects that would enhance my skills or teach me entirely new ones.
- 📫 How to reach me ba.huzil@sasktel.net
